Here is a simple, direct way to learn JS, without having to spend any money.","share_cover":"/img/share-img/learn-javascript-cover-image-full.jpg","_content":"\n_Want to learn JavaScript? Here is a simple, direct way to learn JS, without having to spend any money. (15 minute read)_\n\n**Who this is for:** Anyone new to coding who wants to learn JavaScript, those who already know programming and want to learn JavaScript, and people who want to learn to code but don't know where to start.\n\n**What you need:** Any device that can access a webpage\n\n**Ideal to have:** A device with a large screen (tablet) or a device with a physical keyboard (laptop, desktop, Chromebook)\n\n## Introduction\n\nLearning your first programming language is often a very difficult task for anyone looking to become a developer.\n\nBeyond the vexing problem of which language to learn first, this is an area that often feels like it has the steepest learning curve, even if you already feel fairly tech savvy.\n\nSo the initial question is which language should you learn first?\n\nI'd say start with JavaScript.\n\nReasons to start with JavaScript:\n\n- If you plan to build anything for the web, you'll need to know JavaScript\n- You can now use JavaScript for things beyond building web pages and apps\n- Since JavaScript is built into every browser, you can get started learning JS on any type of device\n\nThat last point might be the most important of all. Other languages, such as Python, are often treated as more beginner friendly, but they require devices where you can install and run custom software and tools.\n\nBut if you only have a smartphone, that might not be an option.\n\nSince you can play with JavaScript on any device, it's much more accessible to folks who might not want to buy a more expensive machine to learn coding, or who might not be able to afford such a machine at all.\n\nBut even if you can afford a more expensive computer, I'd still say start here, both with JavaScript and this plan.\n\nThis is the most direct way I've found to learn JavaScript, and is the guide I wish I had when I was first learning to code\n\n## Step 1: Crash course ([MDN crash course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript))\n\nTo start, read thru this crash course on JavaScript:\n\n<!-- - [javascript-crash-course.md](https://gist.github.com/not-an-aardvark/cb9dbfba750e9a28cb78447491a1d079) (5 minute read) -->\n\n<!-- - [Learn these JavaScript fundamentals and become a better developer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-these-javascript-fundamentals-and-become-a-better-developer-2a031a0dc9cf/) (10 minute read) -->\n\n- [A re-introduction to JavaScript (JS tutorial)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) (30 minute read)\n\n(I'd suggest also checking out the excellent [JavaScript Crash Course For Beginners video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c), which is around 2 hours long, but I recommend the other resource first because I know not everyone has fast enough internet or large enough screens to watch this video)\n\nAlready know how to program in another language? Then you'll learn a lot from this right away.\n\nFully new to programming languages? Then it will feel a little overwhelming, which is normal. The idea here isn't to learn every concept right away, but to gain a little bit of exposure to the new concepts, before you go more in depth into them.\n\nLater on, as you learn more JavaScript, you can go back to these resources to see how much of it feels \"obvious\" now, and you can remind yourself that at the beginning it all seemed so confusing, reminding you of the progress you've made!\n\nReading thru the crash course, and/or watching the video, is all you need to do on your first day.\n\nEveryday after this will combine step 2 and 3 together.\n\n## Step 2: The textbook to use - [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)\n\nIt used to be that the best way to learn how to program was from reading a big textbook. And while books are still great, they can quickly become outdated, not to mention the cost and access issues associated with any physical good.\n\nBut I've found the best JavaScript textbook available online: [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)\n\nIt's an extremely clear, well written walk thru of all the different concepts in JavaScript, broken up into about 160 different sections, or about 700 pages if it was printed out on paper.\n\nIt's also frequently updated, so you don't have to worry about errors or information being out of date.\n\nJust start with the [first section](https://javascript.info/intro), read it and continue from there.\n\nBut because a big part of learning to code is also implementing code to see the results and getting used to the concepts, you'll need more than just a textbook. You also need to be able to practice.\n\n## Step 3: Practice problems to solve - [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/javascript)\n\nJust reading about programming isn't enough to learn, you also need to practice writing code yourself.\n\nThere are a bunch of websites that will give you coding problems to solve, which is a great way to learn and improve your programming abilities, especially when coupled with a great textbook like javascript.info.\n\nBut the problem with most coding problem websites is that they're designed for folks who already know how to code, not those just getting started.\n\nThis is where [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/javascript) comes in.\n\nIt's free to setup an account, and it's designed with beginners in mind, starting off with simple problems and progressively getting harder.\n\nOn top of that, each problem has a Resources tab which can point you to the right documentation for solving a problem, which will help you learn and in turn reinforces these new concepts to you.\n\n(don't forget to check out the Solutions tab after you solve a problem, to see how others have solved it, and learn from their approaches)\n\nThe only downsides with Edabit are that it isn't the easiest to use on a smaller screen device, and the site can be a little slow to load, but it's still the best option for those looking to practice JavaScript.\n\nBetween javascript.info and Edabit, you have two of the best resources to learn JavaScript. Now we just have to put them together.\n\n## Step 4: Alternate between javascript.info and Edabit\n\nOnce you get past your first day of the crash course article, you'll be faced with the question of where to start first: javascript.info or Edabit?\n\nThe answer is to alternate between them.\n\nBeing able to move from one to the other will help keep things fresh and interesting, and allow you to alternate between different modes of learning, helping you reinforce the material you're studying.\n\nMy suggestion is to use this ratio, in this order:\n\n- One javascript.info section\n- Three Edabit challenges\n\nThe only real downside to this approach is that the two resources don't perfectly line up. Since they were made independently from each other, some problems on Edabit, such as those concerning regex and recursion, aren't covered until much later on javascript.info.\n\nIt's also okay to skip problems on Edabit until you learn those topics, or skip ahead in javascript.info so you can tackle them in Edabit.\n\nBut this approach should still work very well for you.\n\n## Step 5: Do a little bit every day\n\nWith 160 sections to read, and almost 1000 practice problems to solve, it's easy to feel overwhelmed!\n\nThe best approach I've found for tackling a big task like this is quite simple: do a little bit per day, and do it each and every day.\n\nEven if all you do is read one section and complete three practice problems per day, as long as you do this every single day, you'll make real progress.\n\nFocus more on making sure you keep a daily streak going, that's much more important than how much work you put in per day, especially when you're starting out.\n\nAfter a while of keeping track of this streak of coding each day, it'll feel like something you just do, making it easier to do a little more work each day.\n\n## Step 6: Tips for success\n\nHere are some helpful tips that will aid you on this path.\n\n### A: Stick to the plan\n\nThis might seem obvious, since I just outlined a plan that will help you learn JavaScript, but it's easy to get distracted.\n\nBefore I had this plan, it was hard not to just jump from one resource to the next, and after a while I realized I was using a lot of energy without making much progress.\n\nSo start here, stick with this plan, and keep moving forward until you know all the content.\n\n### B: Repeat any section or content as needed\n\nThere are going to be times when you come across a concept, read the material on it, do practice problems, and still feel like you don't \"get it.\"\n\nToo many people assume you only need to be exposed to a concept once to fully grasp it.\n\nIt rarely works that way.\n\nI can't count the number of times where I didn't understand something right away after being taught it.\n\nBut there's a simple solution to this issue: go over the material again and again until you understand it.\n\nIt won't matter in the grand scheme of things if it takes you two times, five times, or 20 times of rereading a section in javascript.info to understand it. What matters most is sticking with it, reviewing content until you understand it.\n\nIt never feels like something you can brag about, but to be honest I think most people struggle more with learning than they might admit, and the few how do learn things the first time, every time, are the exceptions, not the rule.\n\nSo I'm here to give you permission to reread that section, or go over that practice problem, again and again until you get it!\n\n### C: Commit to learning in public\n\nA little bit of outside pressure can go a long way in helping you stick to your goals.\n\nThis is something that more formalized learning environments provide quite well. You're expected to learn something, and there's social pressure to keep up.\n\nWhen you're learning on your own, even with a guide like this, it can be hard to stick to whatever schedule you set.\n\nA great option for learning in public is to do the [100 days of code challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).\n\nThe rules are simple:\n\n- Work on learning to code for an hour a day\n- Each day, tweet about your progress and what you did with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag\n\nYou don't have to do an hour a day, you can do more or less, but the point is to commit in public to doing some amount each and every day.\n\nUse this post as your guide for what you need to do each day, then tweet about what you got done in your day.\n\nBe sure to read [Why You Should Do #100DaysOfCode](https://dev.to/thecaitcode/why-you-should-do-100daysofcode-202o) by [Caitlyn Greffly](https://twitter.com/thecaitcode) for a little more information on this approach and the potential benefits of it.\n\n### D: Alter this plan if you have a different approach\n\nI want to give you the best possible start point to learn JavaScript, to get rid of all the distractions and help you focus on what is worth spending time on, but that doesn't mean that my approach will always be the best one for you.\n\nIf you have a sense of something that would work better for you, then alter this plan to fit your approach.\n\nMaybe you have a different resource you'd like to switch in for one I suggested, or you'd like to change the ratio of reading to challenges. As long as you've put thought into it, and you're being careful not to just make changes for change sake, then I say go for it!\n\nI want you to read this post and take these ideas seriously, but of course you should do what works best for you.\n\n### E: This is a great way to learn JavaScript, but it's not the only way\n\nI want to be clear that, while I consider this the best way to learn JavaScript, it's not the only way, and I don't inherently consider those other approaches wrong.\n\nThere are some very heated debates about what you should start learning first, and why one approach is better than others.\n\nOne of the most heated debates is around learning a language, like JS, first, vs learning a framework, like Reach or Vue, first.\n\nI think you should learn JavaScript first, then learn a framework that's built on top of JavaScript next, but the last thing I'd want to do is make someone feel bad if they'd enjoy the other approach more.\n\nI want this to be a great starting point, but always use your own judgement, think for yourself, and avoid anyone who belittles you for choosing something that you know is right for you that they don't care for.\n\n### F: JavaScript is something that everyone can learn\n\nWhat I've outlined here is for anyone who wants to learn JavaScript. No exceptions.\n\nThere seems to be less gatekeeping around this as time goes on, but there are still plenty of folks who treat tech as something that only certain people can learn, or worse yet, only people who fit certain demographics or personality types are capable of learning.\n\nLet me be clear on this, people who believe this, repeat this, or say this, are one of two things: stupid or lying.\n\nThey might buy into stereotypes, or maybe they're just in denial, but everything outlined here is learnable by anyone who wants to put in the time and effort.\n\nNot everyone can learn this within a month, or learn every concept on first exposure.\n\nBut with enough time and work, you can learn JavaScript. Just put in the work to learning it.\n\n## Step 7: Keep going over the material until it's all done\n\nThe plan is pretty simple: cover all the basics in a crash course resource, then go thru both javascript.info and Edabit, alternating between the two, for every one section of javascript.info you read, answer three Edabit challenges.\n\nNow that you know that, keep going thru all the material until you have it all covered.\n\nYou might need to read sections in javascript.info multiple times before you move to the next section. Or maybe you want to read thru it all once, then cover it again and again until it feels like you know it all.\n\nBut stick with it till it gets to that point.\n\nBecause these two resources weren't meant to be used together, there's a good chance that you'll finish the javascript.info content before you finish all the Edabit challenges.\n\nThat's okay. If it gets to that point, just focus on finishing all the remaining Edabit challenges.\n\nThey'll get harder as you answer more of them, but that's okay, it's great practice to solidify the JavaScript skills you've learned from javascript.info.\n\n(and if you get discouraged, go back to the crash course resources to see how much of that content is now obvious to you, you'll be amazed at how far you've come!)\n\nStick with it, then move to the next step.\n\n## Step 8: Next steps\n\nWith just this simple approach of going thru crash course resources at the beginning, then alternating between a learning resource and a JavaScript challenge resource, you'll get very far in terms of learning JavaScript.\n\nIt's a very simple but very large approach to learning JavaScript.\n\nSo what are the next steps?\n\nStart building projects with JavaScript.\n\nBuilding things, even if fairly simple projects, will help solidify not only your newly found JavaScript skills, but will help deepen your understanding of how all the JS pieces fit together.\n\nThere are two big reasons I recommend saving projects till after, and not incorporating them earlier, are:\n\n- You'll need other skills, mainly HTML and CSS, before you can really start building things (I have a good recommendation for learning HTML and CSS below).\n- You'll probably need a desktop or laptop computer, as it will be hard to work on projects if all you have is a tablet or smartphone, and I didn't want that restriction to hinder you with the plan I outlined above.\n\nFor learning HTML and CSS, I'd go to the great [HTML and CSS tutorials from Interneting Is Hard](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/).\n\nFor projects, go with [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com)\n\nBoth are free (JavaScript 30 requires you to sign up), and that is where, in that order, you should spend your time going forward.\n\n## Step 9: Get to work!\n\nThis article should give you the straightforward plan you need to get started.\n\n**To Summarize:**\n\n- Read the [MDN crash course doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) and/or watch the [JavaScript Crash Course For Beginners video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c)\n- Then for every section you read of [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)\n- Do three challenges on [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/javascript)\n- Keep working thru each section of javascript.info until you feel familiar with it all, and keep working until you've solved all the Edabit challenges.\n\nThat's all there is to it, so get to work! :)\n\n<!-- also add??? - https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript -->\n","source":"_posts/learn-javascript.md","raw":"---\ntitle: The Best Way to Learn JavaScript for Free\ndate: 2019-11-24 22:06:33\ntags:\ncomment: false\ndescription: Want to learn JavaScript?

Here is a simple, direct way to learn JS, without having to spend any money. (15 minute read)_\n\n**Who this is for:** Anyone new to coding who wants to learn JavaScript, those who already know programming and want to learn JavaScript, and people who want to learn to code but don't know where to start.\n\n**What you need:** Any device that can access a webpage\n\n**Ideal to have:** A device with a large screen (tablet) or a device with a physical keyboard (laptop, desktop, Chromebook)\n\n## Introduction\n\nLearning your first programming language is often a very difficult task for anyone looking to become a developer.\n\nBeyond the vexing problem of which language to learn first, this is an area that often feels like it has the steepest learning curve, even if you already feel fairly tech savvy.\n\nSo the initial question is which language should you learn first?\n\nI'd say start with JavaScript.\n\nReasons to start with JavaScript:\n\n- If you plan to build anything for the web, you'll need to know JavaScript\n- You can now use JavaScript for things beyond building web pages and apps\n- Since JavaScript is built into every browser, you can get started learning JS on any type of device\n\nThat last point might be the most important of all. Other languages, such as Python, are often treated as more beginner friendly, but they require devices where you can install and run custom software and tools.\n\nBut if you only have a smartphone, that might not be an option.\n\nSince you can play with JavaScript on any device, it's much more accessible to folks who might not want to buy a more expensive machine to learn coding, or who might not be able to afford such a machine at all.\n\nBut even if you can afford a more expensive computer, I'd still say start here, both with JavaScript and this plan.\n\nThis is the most direct way I've found to learn JavaScript, and is the guide I wish I had when I was first learning to code\n\n## Step 1: Crash course ([MDN crash course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript))\n\nTo start, read thru this crash course on JavaScript:\n\n<!-- - [javascript-crash-course.md](https://gist.github.com/not-an-aardvark/cb9dbfba750e9a28cb78447491a1d079) (5 minute read) -->\n\n<!-- - [Learn these JavaScript fundamentals and become a better developer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-these-javascript-fundamentals-and-become-a-better-developer-2a031a0dc9cf/) (10 minute read) -->\n\n- [A re-introduction to JavaScript (JS tutorial)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) (30 minute read)\n\n(I'd suggest also checking out the excellent [JavaScript Crash Course For Beginners video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c), which is around 2 hours long, but I recommend the other resource first because I know not everyone has fast enough internet or large enough screens to watch this video)\n\nAlready know how to program in another language? Then you'll learn a lot from this right away.\n\nFully new to programming languages? Then it will feel a little overwhelming, which is normal. The idea here isn't to learn every concept right away, but to gain a little bit of exposure to the new concepts, before you go more in depth into them.\n\nLater on, as you learn more JavaScript, you can go back to these resources to see how much of it feels \"obvious\" now, and you can remind yourself that at the beginning it all seemed so confusing, reminding you of the progress you've made!\n\nReading thru the crash course, and/or watching the video, is all you need to do on your first day.\n\nEveryday after this will combine step 2 and 3 together.\n\n## Step 2: The textbook to use - [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)\n\nIt used to be that the best way to learn how to program was from reading a big textbook. And while books are still great, they can quickly become outdated, not to mention the cost and access issues associated with any physical good.\n\nBut I've found the best JavaScript textbook available online: [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)\n\nIt's an extremely clear, well written walk thru of all the different concepts in JavaScript, broken up into about 160 different sections, or about 700 pages if it was printed out on paper.\n\nIt's also frequently updated, so you don't have to worry about errors or information being out of date.\n\nJust start with the [first section](https://javascript.info/intro), read it and continue from there.\n\nBut because a big part of learning to code is also implementing code to see the results and getting used to the concepts, you'll need more than just a textbook. You also need to be able to practice.\n\n## Step 3: Practice problems to solve - [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/javascript)\n\nJust reading about programming isn't enough to learn, you also need to practice writing code yourself.\n\nThere are a bunch of websites that will give you coding problems to solve, which is a great way to learn and improve your programming abilities, especially when coupled with a great textbook like javascript.info.\n\nBut the problem with most coding problem websites is that they're designed for folks who already know how to code, not those just getting started.\n\nThis is where [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/javascript) comes in.\n\nIt's free to setup an account, and it's designed with beginners in mind, starting off with simple problems and progressively getting harder.\n\nOn top of that, each problem has a Resources tab which can point you to the right documentation for solving a problem, which will help you learn and in turn reinforces these new concepts to you.\n\n(don't forget to check out the Solutions tab after you solve a problem, to see how others have solved it, and learn from their approaches)\n\nThe only downsides with Edabit are that it isn't the easiest to use on a smaller screen device, and the site can be a little slow to load, but it's still the best option for those looking to practice JavaScript.\n\nBetween javascript.info and Edabit, you have two of the best resources to learn JavaScript. Now we just have to put them together.\n\n## Step 4: Alternate between javascript.info and Edabit\n\nOnce you get past your first day of the crash course article, you'll be faced with the question of where to start first: javascript.info or Edabit?\n\nThe answer is to alternate between them.\n\nBeing able to move from one to the other will help keep things fresh and interesting, and allow you to alternate between different modes of learning, helping you reinforce the material you're studying.\n\nMy suggestion is to use this ratio, in this order:\n\n- One javascript.info section\n- Three Edabit challenges\n\nThe only real downside to this approach is that the two resources don't perfectly line up. Since they were made independently from each other, some problems on Edabit, such as those concerning regex and recursion, aren't covered until much later on javascript.info.\n\nIt's also okay to skip problems on Edabit until you learn those topics, or skip ahead in javascript.info so you can tackle them in Edabit.\n\nBut this approach should still work very well for you.\n\n## Step 5: Do a little bit every day\n\nWith 160 sections to read, and almost 1000 practice problems to solve, it's easy to feel overwhelmed!\n\nThe best approach I've found for tackling a big task like this is quite simple: do a little bit per day, and do it each and every day.\n\nEven if all you do is read one section and complete three practice problems per day, as long as you do this every single day, you'll make real progress.\n\nFocus more on making sure you keep a daily streak going, that's much more important than how much work you put in per day, especially when you're starting out.\n\nAfter a while of keeping track of this streak of coding each day, it'll feel like something you just do, making it easier to do a little more work each day.\n\n## Step 6: Tips for success\n\nHere are some helpful tips that will aid you on this path.\n\n### A: Stick to the plan\n\nThis might seem obvious, since I just outlined a plan that will help you learn JavaScript, but it's easy to get distracted.\n\nBefore I had this plan, it was hard not to just jump from one resource to the next, and after a while I realized I was using a lot of energy without making much progress.\n\nSo start here, stick with this plan, and keep moving forward until you know all the content.\n\n### B: Repeat any section or content as needed\n\nThere are going to be times when you come across a concept, read the material on it, do practice problems, and still feel like you don't \"get it.\"\n\nToo many people assume you only need to be exposed to a concept once to fully grasp it.\n\nIt rarely works that way.\n\nI can't count the number of times where I didn't understand something right away after being taught it.\n\nBut there's a simple solution to this issue: go over the material again and again until you understand it.\n\nIt won't matter in the grand scheme of things if it takes you two times, five times, or 20 times of rereading a section in javascript.info to understand it.

You’re expected to learn something, and there’s social pressure to keep up.</p><p>When you’re learning on your own, even with a guide like this, it can be hard to stick to whatever schedule you set.</p><p>A great option for learning in public is to do the <a href=\"https://www.100daysofcode.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">100 days of code challenge</a>.</p><p>The rules are simple:</p><ul><li>Work on learning to code for an hour a day</li><li>Each day, tweet about your progress and what you did with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag</li></ul><p>You don’t have to do an hour a day, you can do more or less, but the point is to commit in public to doing some amount each and every day.</p><p>Use this post as your guide for what you need to do each day, then tweet about what you got done in your day.</p><p>Be sure to read <a href=\"https://dev.to/thecaitcode/why-you-should-do-100daysofcode-202o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why You Should Do #100DaysOfCode</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thecaitcode\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Caitlyn Greffly</a> for a little more information on this approach and the potential benefits of it.</p><h3 id=\"D-Alter-this-plan-if-you-have-a-different-approach\"><a href=\"#D-Alter-this-plan-if-you-have-a-different-approach\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"D: Alter this plan if you have a different approach\"></a>D: Alter this plan if you have a different approach</h3><p>I want to give you the best possible start point to learn JavaScript, to get rid of all the distractions and help you focus on what is worth spending time on, but that doesn’t mean that my approach will always be the best one for you.</p><p>If you have a sense of something that would work better for you, then alter this plan to fit your approach.</p><p>Maybe you have a different resource you’d like to switch in for one I suggested, or you’d like to change the ratio of reading to challenges. As long as you’ve put thought into it, and you’re being careful not to just make changes for change sake, then I say go for it!</p><p>I want you to read this post and take these ideas seriously, but of course you should do what works best for you.</p><h3 id=\"E-This-is-a-great-way-to-learn-JavaScript-but-it’s-not-the-only-way\"><a href=\"#E-This-is-a-great-way-to-learn-JavaScript-but-it’s-not-the-only-way\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"E: This is a great way to learn JavaScript, but it’s not the only way\"></a>E: This is a great way to learn JavaScript, but it’s not the only way</h3><p>I want to be clear that, while I consider this the best way to learn JavaScript, it’s not the only way, and I don’t inherently consider those other approaches wrong.</p><p>There are some very heated debates about what you should start learning first, and why one approach is better than others.</p><p>One of the most heated debates is around learning a language, like JS, first, vs learning a framework, like Reach or Vue, first.</p><p>I think you should learn JavaScript first, then learn a framework that’s built on top of JavaScript next, but the last thing I’d want to do is make someone feel bad if they’d enjoy the other approach more.</p><p>I want this to be a great starting point, but always use your own judgement, think for yourself, and avoid anyone who belittles you for choosing something that you know is right for you that they don’t care for.</p><h3 id=\"F-JavaScript-is-something-that-everyone-can-learn\"><a href=\"#F-JavaScript-is-something-that-everyone-can-learn\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"F: JavaScript is something that everyone can learn\"></a>F: JavaScript is something that everyone can learn</h3><p>What I’ve outlined here is for anyone who wants to learn JavaScript. No exceptions.</p><p>There seems to be less gatekeeping around this as time goes on, but there are still plenty of folks who treat tech as something that only certain people can learn, or worse yet, only people who fit certain demographics or personality types are capable of learning.</p><p>Let me be clear on this, people who believe this, repeat this, or say this, are one of two things: stupid or lying.</p><p>They might buy into stereotypes, or maybe they’re just in denial, but everything outlined here is learnable by anyone who wants to put in the time and effort.</p><p>Not everyone can learn this within a month, or learn every concept on first exposure.</p><p>But with enough time and work, you can learn JavaScript. Just put in the work to learning it.</p><h2 id=\"Step-7-Keep-going-over-the-material-until-it’s-all-done\"><a href=\"#Step-7-Keep-going-over-the-material-until-it’s-all-done\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Step 7: Keep going over the material until it’s all done\"></a>Step 7: Keep going over the material until it’s all done</h2><p>The plan is pretty simple: cover all the basics in a crash course resource, then go thru both javascript.info and Edabit, alternating between the two, for every one section of javascript.info you read, answer three Edabit challenges.</p><p>Now that you know that, keep going thru all the material until you have it all covered.</p><p>You might need to read sections in javascript.info multiple times before you move to the next section. Or maybe you want to read thru it all once, then cover it again and again until it feels like you know it all.</p><p>But stick with it till it gets to that point.</p><p>Because these two resources weren’t meant to be used together, there’s a good chance that you’ll finish the javascript.info content before you finish all the Edabit challenges.</p><p>That’s okay. If it gets to that point, just focus on finishing all the remaining Edabit challenges.</p><p>They’ll get harder as you answer more of them, but that’s okay, it’s great practice to solidify the JavaScript skills you’ve learned from javascript.info.</p><p>(and if you get discouraged, go back to the crash course resources to see how much of that content is now obvious to you, you’ll be amazed at how far you’ve come!)</p><p>Stick with it, then move to the next step.</p><h2 id=\"Step-8-Next-steps\"><a href=\"#Step-8-Next-steps\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Step 8: Next steps\"></a>Step 8: Next steps</h2><p>With just this simple approach of going thru crash course resources at the beginning, then alternating between a learning resource and a JavaScript challenge resource, you’ll get very far in terms of learning JavaScript.</p><p>It’s a very simple but very large approach to learning JavaScript.</p><p>So what are the next steps?</p><p>Start building projects with JavaScript.</p><p>Building things, even if fairly simple projects, will help solidify not only your newly found JavaScript skills, but will help deepen your understanding of how all the JS pieces fit together.</p><p>There are two big reasons I recommend saving projects till after, and not incorporating them earlier, are:</p><ul><li>You’ll need other skills, mainly HTML and CSS, before you can really start building things (I have a good recommendation for learning HTML and CSS below).</li><li>You’ll probably need a desktop or laptop computer, as it will be hard to work on projects if all you have is a tablet or smartphone, and I didn’t want that restriction to hinder you with the plan I outlined above.</li></ul><p>For learning HTML and CSS, I’d go to the great <a href=\"https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HTML and CSS tutorials from Interneting Is Hard</a>.</p><p>For projects, go with <a href=\"https://javascript30.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JavaScript 30</a></p><p>Both are free (JavaScript 30 requires you to sign up), and that is where, in that order, you should spend your time going forward.</p><h2 id=\"Step-9-Get-to-work\"><a href=\"#Step-9-Get-to-work\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Step 9: Get to work!\"></a>Step 9: Get to work!</h2><p>This article should give you the straightforward plan you need to get started.</p><p><strong>To Summarize:</strong></p><ul><li>Read the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MDN crash course doc</a> and/or watch the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JavaScript Crash Course For Beginners video</a></li><li>Then for every section you read of <a href=\"https://javascript.info/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">javascript.info</a></li><li>Do three challenges on <a href=\"https://edabit.com/challenges/javascript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Edabit</a></li><li>Keep working thru each section of javascript.info until you feel familiar with it all, and keep working until you’ve solved all the Edabit challenges.</li></ul><p>That’s all there is to it, so get to work! :)</p>"}],"PostAsset":[],"PostCategory":[],"PostTag":[],"Tag":[]}}
