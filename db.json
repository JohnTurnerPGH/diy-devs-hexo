Here is a simple, direct way to learn JS, without having to spend any money.","_content":"\n_Want to learn JavaScript? Here is a simple, direct way to learn JS, without having to spend any money. (x min read)_\n\n**Who this is for:** Anyone new to coding who wants to learn JavaScript, folks who already know how to code but want to learn JavaScript, and people who want to learn how to program, but don't know where to start.\n\n**What you need:** Any device that can access a webpage\n\n**Ideal to have:** A device with a large screen (tablet) or a device with a physical keyboard (laptop, desktop, Chromebook)\n\nThere are lots of challenges for anyone looking to learn to code, but learning your first programming language is often the most worrying of all the things you'll need to learn.\n\nBeyond picking the first language to start learning, this is also the area that often feels like it has the steepest learning curve to it, even if you already feel like you're fairly tech savvy.\n\n**Which language should you learn first?**\n\nI'd say start with JavaScript.\n\nReasons to start with JavaScript:\n\n- If you need to build anything for the web, you'll have to use JavaScript to some extent\n- As the web has grown, so have the use cases for JavaScript, so you can use your JavaScript skills in lots of different ways\n- Because it's built into every web browser, you can play around with it without any setup\n\nThat last point is probably the most important, because while there are lots of other languages that are often recommended for beginners (Python being one of the most recommended for beginners), not needing to set anything up is a big plus, especially if you're learning on a device that limits what you can install, such as a smart phone or tablet.\n\nBut where to start?\n\nThere are a lot of online resources for learning JavaScript, the only problem being that many of these resources are out of date, incomplete, or contain errors. And too many folks that put together guides go with the approach of \"here are a dozen sites, figure it out\" which is overwhelming if you're just starting.\n\nThis is the guide I wish I had when I was first learning to code, and I hope it saves you a lot of frustration and time!\n\n## Step 1: Crash course ([MDN crash course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript))\n\nAll you have to do on your first day of learning JavaScript is read thru this:\n\n<!-- - [javascript-crash-course.md](https://gist.github.com/not-an-aardvark/cb9dbfba750e9a28cb78447491a1d079) (5 minute read) -->\n\n<!-- - [Learn these JavaScript fundamentals and become a better developer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-these-javascript-fundamentals-and-become-a-better-developer-2a031a0dc9cf/) (10 minute read) -->\n\n- [A re-introduction to JavaScript (JS tutorial)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) (30 minute read)\n\n(if you prefer video, I'd suggest also checking out the excellent [JavaScript Crash Course For Beginners video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c), which is under 2 hours long)\n\nAlready familiar with other programming languages? Then you'll probably pick up a lot right away.\n\nNew to coding? Then it might feel a little overwhelming. Don't worry, that's normal. Even if you feel you're not getting everything, keep reading. This will be helpful not only in getting started, but later on will serve as markers to help you realize how far you've come.\n\nEveryday after this will combine step 2 and 3 together.\n\n## Step 2: The textbook to use - [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)\n\nNot that long ago, when the internet was much slower and harder to access, the preferred way to learn programming was thru books. Books are still a great way to learn, but at the time they were the main way to learn to code.\n\nThere are a million stories of someone finding one big textbook, reading it cover to cover, and that being how they got started.\n\nThe problem with physical books is that they can quickly become outdated, as well as the cost and access issues associated with physical goods.\n\nBut I've found the best JavaScript textbook available online: [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)\n\nIt's an extremely clear, well written walk thru of all the different concepts in JavaScript, broken up into around 160 different sections, or about 700 pages if it was printed out on paper.\n\nJust start with the [first section](https://javascript.info/intro), read it and keep going.\n\nBut because a big part of learning to code is also implementing code to see the results and getting used to the concepts, a textbook like this isn't the whole picture. You also need to be able to practice.\n\n## Step 3: Practice problems to solve - [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/javascript)\n\nYou can learn with just a textbook, but it can be kinda hard.\n\nWhen I learned math in school, it wasn't just reading a chapter and assuming that I knew the material. It was doing practice problems, often very similar ones over and over until the material became second nature.\n\nAlong the same line, there are lots of websites that give you coding practice, by presenting to you different types of coding challenges and problems to solve.\n\nThe problem is that most of these sites are designed for folks who already know how to code, and want to sharpen their skills, but are quite challenging for those new to coding.\n\nThis is where [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/javascript) comes in.\n\nIt's designed with beginners in mind, starting off with simple problems and progressively getting harder. On top of that, each problem has a resources tab that can help point you in the right direction of how to solve a problem, without giving too much away.\n\nThe only downsides with Edabit are that the site isn't the easiest to use on a smaller screen device, and the site can be a little slow, but it's the best option I've seen out there for good coding challenges for beginners.\n\n## Step 4: Alternate between javascript.info and Edabit\n\nOnce you get past your first day of the crash course articles, you'll be faced with the question of where to start first: javascript.info or Edabit?\n\nThe answer is to alternate between them.\n\nBeing able to move from one to the other will help keep things fresh and interesting, and allow you to alternate between different modes of learning, helping you reinforce the material you're studying.\n\nMy suggestion is to use this ratio, in this order:\n\n- One javascript.info section\n- Three Edabit challenges\n\nThe only real downside to this approach is that the two resources don't perfectly line up. They were made independently from each other, and while they both feel like the missing half for the other, some problems on Edabit around things like regex and recursion aren't covered until much later in javascript.info.\n\nIt's also okay to skip problems on Edabit until you learn those topics, or skip ahead in javascript.info so you can tackle them in Edabit.\n\nBut roughly this ratio will work pretty well for you.\n\n## Step 5: Do a little bit every day\n\nWith something like this, it's easy to get overwhelmed. Around 160 sections to read, and almost 1000 problems to work on. It can feel like a lot!\n\nThe easiest approach I've found for tackling a big task like this is simple: do a little bit, every single day.\n\nIt doesn't have to be a lot, you can just read one section and complete three problems and then stop. But don't take any days off.\n\nKeep track of your progress of doing a little work each day, using a habit tracking app like Habit List or Habit Bull, or even a physical calendar, and after a while it'll feel like something you'll just do, not something you'll dread.\n\nAnd the funny thing about habits like this is that once you build a small habit, it doesn't seem like a big deal to do a little more work on top of that, helping you to get more done and learn more faster.\n\n## Step 6: Tips for success\n\nHere are a few helpful tips that will go a long way in aiding you on this path.\n\n### A: Stick to the plan\n\nThis might sound obvious, since I just spent this entire article outlining a plan that will help you learn JavaScript, but it's so easy to get distracted.\n\nBefore I had figured out the few best resources to use, all outlined here, it was so easy to jump from one resource to the next, and after enough time of doing this it feels like treading water: you're using a lot of energy but making very little progress.\n\nThat's not to say that this plan is all you'll ever need. In fact, I can guarantee you that you'll want to learn more than what this plan gives you.\n\nBut start here, stick to it, and keep moving forward\n\n### B: Repeat anything as needed\n\nThere are going to be points in learning where you come across a concept, read the material, do practice problems, and still feel like you don't \"get it.\"\n\nToo many people who make learn to code materials assume a \"one and done\" approach will work for everyone.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nIn fact, there have been many times when I learned about a concept and didn't get it at first.\n\nThe solution?\n\nRepeat that section until you understand it.\n\nAt the end of the day, it doesn't matter if you have to reread a section in javascript.info two times or 20 times. What matters is sticking with it, repeating it as you need to until you understand the concept.\n\nThis never leads to any real bragging rights, but to be honest I think most people actually struggle more with learning than the admit, and the few who do learn things the first time every time are the exceptions, not the rule.\n\nI'm here to give you permission to reread that section, or go over that practice problem, again and again until you feel you understand it!\n\n### C: Commit to learning in public\n\nA little bit of outside pressure can go a long way in helping you stick to your goals.\n\nThis is something that more formalized learning environments provide quite well. You're expected to learn something, and there's social pressure to keep up.\n\nWhen it's just you, it can be hard to stick with whatever schedule you set.\n\nA great option for committing to learn in a more public way is to start with the [100 days of code challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).\n\nThe rules are pretty simple:\n\n- Go on your Twitter account (or setup a Twitter account if you don't already have one)\n- Work on learning to code for an hour a day\n- Each day, tweet about your progress and what you did with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag\n\nYou don't have to do a hour a day, you can do more or less, but the point is to commit in public to doing some amount each and every day.\n\nUse this post as your guide, sticking with the read one section, solve three practice problems model for what you need to do.\n\nThen tweet about what you accomplished each day.\n\nBe sure to check out the official [100 days of code Twitter account](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) to see how others are using this approach to stick with learning to code.\n\n### D: Alter this plan if you have a different approach\n\nI want to give you the best starting point possible to learn JavaScript, but that doesn't mean that my approach is the best one for you.\n\nFeel free to alter this plan if you have a sense of something that would work better for you.\n\nLike Edabit, but have a different resource that outlines JavaScript that you'd like to use instead of javascript.info? Use that one instead!\n\nLike javascript.info, but have a different coding challenge site you'd rather use? Go for it, use that one!\n\nFeel you should do more challenges for each section you read? Make that change!\n\nI want you to read this article and take the ideas I put here seriously, but of course you should do what works best for you, and if you'd like to make a change, make it!\n\n## Step 7: Why this guide is incomplete\n\nWith just the simple approach of using a crash course at the beginning (and going back to it to see how much you've learned since you've started), then alternating between one learning resource and one practice resource, you'll go very far in terms of learning JavaScript.\n\nBut I wouldn't say this is complete.\n\n_There's a third part, which is working on projects._\n\nBuilding things, even if fairly simple, will help you solidify not only your JavaScript fundamentals, but it could also be argued that in building projects, you'll understand more deeply how all the JavaScript pieces fit together.\n\nOne reason that I recommend saving projects to the end, after you've worked thru the approach outlined here, is that you can gain so much from this approach before you even start a project, but also that for building projects you'll probably need something more like a laptop or desktop computer, and that they become much much harder to complete on a smart phone, which might be all you have access to.\n\nBut a great resource for projects to get started with once you've gone thru the process outlined here is [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com), which is a free JavaScript project resource, giving you 30 different projects to work on to really solidify your JavaScript skills.\n\nThe only thing extra that you'll need for those projects is knowledge of both HTML and CSS, which isn't covered in this article.\n\nFor a great free article to learn both, I'd go to the great [HTML and CSS tutorials from Interneting Is Hard](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/). It covers pretty much all you'll need to know to start working on JavaScript projects more fully.\n\n## Step 8: The best way, but not the only way\n\nThis approach is what I consider the best way to learn JavaScript, but I want to be clear it is far from the only way.\n\nThere are lots of very heated debates about what to start learning first, and why one approach is better than others.\n\nClearly I believe in this approach, but I don't believe that other approaches are wrong, or that if you don't follow this one you'll be in trouble.\n\nA common debate is learning a programming language first vs learning a framework first.\n\nI'm very much in the camp of learning JavaScript before a JS framework or library, such as Reach or Vue, but there are lots of folks who learned a framework, library, or something else first, and then went back to learn more about the underlying language, and that approach can work great too!\n\nThe last thing I'd want to be responsible for is making someone feel bad or discouraged because they wanted to learn another way, read this, and then felt they had to take this approach when they didn't want to.\n\nThis fits into the point above of \"Alter this plan if you have a different approach,\" and the reason I'm adding to that idea is to reassure you that there isn't one right way, even when I think my approach is the best\n\n## Step 9: This is for everyone\n\nThe point I'm about to make is becoming less of an issue, but it's still worth making.\n\nWhat I've outlined here is for everyone who wants to learn JavaScript. No exceptions.\n\nThere seems to be less and less gatekeeping around this as time goes on, but there are still plenty of folks who treat learning tech as something that only certain people can learn, or worse yet, only people who fit certain demographics are capable of learning.\n\nLet me be clear. People who believe this, repeat this, or say this, are one of two things: stupid or lying.\n\nThat's all there is to it.\n\nThey might buy into dangerous stereotypes, or maybe they're just lying to themselves, but everything outlined here is learnable by anyone who wants to put the time and effort in.\n\nNow not everyone could learn all of this in one week, or learn every concept on first exposure to it. But with enough time and work, you can learn JavaScript.\n\nJust need to put the work in to learning it.\n\n## Step 10: Get to work!\n\nThis article should give you the straightforward plan you need to get started.\n\n**In the simplest terms:**\n\n- Read the [MDN crash course doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) and/or watch the [JavaScript Crash Course For Beginners video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c)\n- Then for every section you read of [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)\n- Do three challenges on [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/javascript)\n- Repeat all of this until you feel solid on the language\n\nThen after that:\n\n- Learn HTML and CSS from [Interneting Is Hard](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/)\n- Work on projects from [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com)\n\nThat's all there is to it, so get to work!\n\n<!-- also add??? - https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript -->\n","source":"_posts/learn-javascript.md","raw":"---\ntitle: The Best Way to Learn JavaScript for Free\ndate: 2019-11-10 22:06:33\ntags:\ncomment: false\ndescription: Want to learn JavaScript? Here is a simple, direct way to learn JS, without having to spend any money.\n---\n\n_Want to learn JavaScript? Here is a simple, direct way to learn JS, without having to spend any money. (x min read)_\n\n**Who this is for:** Anyone new to coding who wants to learn JavaScript, folks who already know how to code but want to learn JavaScript, and people who want to learn how to program, but don't know where to start.\n\n**What you need:** Any device that can access a webpage\n\n**Ideal to have:** A device with a large screen (tablet) or a device with a physical keyboard (laptop, desktop, Chromebook)\n\nThere are lots of challenges for anyone looking to learn to code, but learning your first programming language is often the most worrying of all the things you'll need to learn.\n\nBeyond picking the first language to start learning, this is also the area that often feels like it has the steepest learning curve to it, even if you already feel like you're fairly tech savvy.\n\n**Which language should you learn first?**\n\nI'd say start with JavaScript.\n\nReasons to start with JavaScript:\n\n- If you need to build anything for the web, you'll have to use JavaScript to some extent\n- As the web has grown, so have the use cases for JavaScript, so you can use your JavaScript skills in lots of different ways\n- Because it's built into every web browser, you can play around with it without any setup\n\nThat last point is probably the most important, because while there are lots of other languages that are often recommended for beginners (Python being one of the most recommended for beginners), not needing to set anything up is a big plus, especially if you're learning on a device that limits what you can install, such as a smart phone or tablet.\n\nBut where to start?\n\nThere are a lot of online resources for learning JavaScript, the only problem being that many of these resources are out of date, incomplete, or contain errors. And too many folks that put together guides go with the approach of \"here are a dozen sites, figure it out\" which is overwhelming if you're just starting.\n\nThis is the guide I wish I had when I was first learning to code, and I hope it saves you a lot of frustration and time!\n\n## Step 1: Crash course ([MDN crash course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript))\n\nAll you have to do on your first day of learning JavaScript is read thru this:\n\n<!-- - [javascript-crash-course.md](https://gist.github.com/not-an-aardvark/cb9dbfba750e9a28cb78447491a1d079) (5 minute read) -->\n\n<!-- - [Learn these JavaScript fundamentals and become a better developer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-these-javascript-fundamentals-and-become-a-better-developer-2a031a0dc9cf/) (10 minute read) -->\n\n- [A re-introduction to JavaScript (JS tutorial)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) (30 minute read)\n\n(if you prefer video, I'd suggest also checking out the excellent [JavaScript Crash Course For Beginners video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c), which is under 2 hours long)\n\nAlready familiar with other programming languages? Then you'll probably pick up a lot right away.\n\nNew to coding? Then it might feel a little overwhelming. Don't worry, that's normal. Even if you feel you're not getting everything, keep reading. This will be helpful not only in getting started, but later on will serve as markers to help you realize how far you've come.\n\nEveryday after this will combine step 2 and 3 together.\n\n## Step 2: The textbook to use - [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)\n\nNot that long ago, when the internet was much slower and harder to access, the preferred way to learn programming was thru books. Books are still a great way to learn, but at the time they were the main way to learn to code.\n\nThere are a million stories of someone finding one big textbook, reading it cover to cover, and that being how they got started.\n\nThe problem with physical books is that they can quickly become outdated, as well as the cost and access issues associated with physical goods.\n\nBut I've found the best JavaScript textbook available online: [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)\n\nIt's an extremely clear, well written walk thru of all the different concepts in JavaScript, broken up into around 160 different sections, or about 700 pages if it was printed out on paper.\n\nJust start with the [first section](https://javascript.info/intro), read it and keep going.\n\nBut because a big part of learning to code is also implementing code to see the results and getting used to the concepts, a textbook like this isn't the whole picture. You also need to be able to practice.\n\n## Step 3: Practice problems to solve - [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/javascript)\n\nYou can learn with just a textbook, but it can be kinda hard.\n\nWhen I learned math in school, it wasn't just reading a chapter and assuming that I knew the material. It was doing practice problems, often very similar ones over and over until the material became second nature.\n\nAlong the same line, there are lots of websites that give you coding practice, by presenting to you different types of coding challenges and problems to solve.\n\nThe problem is that most of these sites are designed for folks who already know how to code, and want to sharpen their skills, but are quite challenging for those new to coding.\n\nThis is where [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/javascript) comes in.\n\nIt's designed with beginners in mind, starting off with simple problems and progressively getting harder. On top of that, each problem has a resources tab that can help point you in the right direction of how to solve a problem, without giving too much away.\n\nThe only downsides with Edabit are that the site isn't the easiest to use on a smaller screen device, and the site can be a little slow, but it's the best option I've seen out there for good coding challenges for beginners.\n\n## Step 4: Alternate between javascript.info and Edabit\n\nOnce you get past your first day of the crash course articles, you'll be faced with the question of where to start first: javascript.info or Edabit?\n\nThe answer is to alternate between them.\n\nBeing able to move from one to the other will help keep things fresh and interesting, and allow you to alternate between different modes of learning, helping you reinforce the material you're studying.\n\nMy suggestion is to use this ratio, in this order:\n\n- One javascript.info section\n- Three Edabit challenges\n\nThe only real downside to this approach is that the two resources don't perfectly line up. They were made independently from each other, and while they both feel like the missing half for the other, some problems on Edabit around things like regex and recursion aren't covered until much later in javascript.info.\n\nIt's also okay to skip problems on Edabit until you learn those topics, or skip ahead in javascript.info so you can tackle them in Edabit.\n\nBut roughly this ratio will work pretty well for you.\n\n## Step 5: Do a little bit every day\n\nWith something like this, it's easy to get overwhelmed. Around 160 sections to read, and almost 1000 problems to work on. It can feel like a lot!\n\nThe easiest approach I've found for tackling a big task like this is simple: do a little bit, every single day.\n\nIt doesn't have to be a lot, you can just read one section and complete three problems and then stop. But don't take any days off.\n\nKeep track of your progress of doing a little work each day, using a habit tracking app like Habit List or Habit Bull, or even a physical calendar, and after a while it'll feel like something you'll just do, not something you'll dread.\n\nAnd the funny thing about habits like this is that once you build a small habit, it doesn't seem like a big deal to do a little more work on top of that, helping you to get more done and learn more faster.\n\n## Step 6: Tips for success\n\nHere are a few helpful tips that will go a long way in aiding you on this path.\n\n### A: Stick to the plan\n\nThis might sound obvious, since I just spent this entire article outlining a plan that will help you learn JavaScript, but it's so easy to get distracted.\n\nBefore I had figured out the few best resources to use, all outlined here, it was so easy to jump from one resource to the next, and after enough time of doing this it feels like treading water: you're using a lot of energy but making very little progress.\n\nThat's not to say that this plan is all you'll ever need. In fact, I can guarantee you that you'll want to learn more than what this plan gives you.\n\nBut start here, stick to it, and keep moving forward\n\n### B: Repeat anything as needed\n\nThere are going to be points in learning where you come across a concept, read the material, do practice problems, and still feel like you don't \"get it.\"\n\nToo many people who make learn to code materials assume a \"one and done\" approach will work for everyone.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nIn fact, there have been many times when I learned about a concept and didn't get it at first.\n\nThe solution?\n\nRepeat that section until you understand it.\n\nAt the end of the day, it doesn't matter if you have to reread a section in javascript.info two times or 20 times. What matters is sticking with it, repeating it as you need to until you understand the concept.\n\nThis never leads to any real bragging rights, but to be honest I think most people actually struggle more with learning than the admit, and the few who do learn things the first time every time are the exceptions, not the rule.\n\nI'm here to give you permission to reread that section, or go over that practice problem, again and again until you feel you understand it!\n\n### C: Commit to learning in public\n\nA little bit of outside pressure can go a long way in helping you stick to your goals.\n\nThis is something that more formalized learning environments provide quite well. You're expected to learn something, and there's social pressure to keep up.\n\nWhen it's just you, it can be hard to stick with whatever schedule you set.\n\nA great option for committing to learn in a more public way is to start with the [100 days of code challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).\n\nThe rules are pretty simple:\n\n- Go on your Twitter account (or setup a Twitter account if you don't already have one)\n- Work on learning to code for an hour a day\n- Each day, tweet about your progress and what you did with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag\n\nYou don't have to do a hour a day, you can do more or less, but the point is to commit in public to doing some amount each and every day.\n\nUse this post as your guide, sticking with the read one section, solve three practice problems model for what you need to do.\n\nThen tweet about what you accomplished each day.\n\nBe sure to check out the official [100 days of code Twitter account](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) to see how others are using this approach to stick with learning to code.\n\n### D: Alter this plan if you have a different approach\n\nI want to give you the best starting point possible to learn JavaScript, but that doesn't mean that my approach is the best one for you.\n\nFeel free to alter this plan if you have a sense of something that would work better for you.\n\nLike Edabit, but have a different resource that outlines JavaScript that you'd like to use instead of javascript.info?

Here is a simple, direct way to learn JS, without having to spend any money. (x min read)</em></p><p><strong>Who this is for:</strong> Anyone new to coding who wants to learn JavaScript, folks who already know how to code but want to learn JavaScript, and people who want to learn how to program, but don’t know where to start.</p><p><strong>What you need:</strong> Any device that can access a webpage</p><p><strong>Ideal to have:</strong> A device with a large screen (tablet) or a device with a physical keyboard (laptop, desktop, Chromebook)</p><p>There are lots of challenges for anyone looking to learn to code, but learning your first programming language is often the most worrying of all the things you’ll need to learn.</p><p>Beyond picking the first language to start learning, this is also the area that often feels like it has the steepest learning curve to it, even if you already feel like you’re fairly tech savvy.</p><p><strong>Which language should you learn first?</strong></p><p>I’d say start with JavaScript.</p><p>Reasons to start with JavaScript:</p><ul><li>If you need to build anything for the web, you’ll have to use JavaScript to some extent</li><li>As the web has grown, so have the use cases for JavaScript, so you can use your JavaScript skills in lots of different ways</li><li>Because it’s built into every web browser, you can play around with it without any setup</li></ul><p>That last point is probably the most important, because while there are lots of other languages that are often recommended for beginners (Python being one of the most recommended for beginners), not needing to set anything up is a big plus, especially if you’re learning on a device that limits what you can install, such as a smart phone or tablet.</p><p>But where to start?</p><p>There are a lot of online resources for learning JavaScript, the only problem being that many of these resources are out of date, incomplete, or contain errors. And too many folks that put together guides go with the approach of “here are a dozen sites, figure it out” which is overwhelming if you’re just starting.</p><p>This is the guide I wish I had when I was first learning to code, and I hope it saves you a lot of frustration and time!</p><h2 id=\"Step-1-Crash-course-MDN-crash-course\"><a href=\"#Step-1-Crash-course-MDN-crash-course\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Step 1: Crash course (MDN crash course)\"></a>Step 1: Crash course (<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MDN crash course</a>)</h2><p>All you have to do on your first day of learning JavaScript is read thru this:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A re-introduction to JavaScript (JS tutorial)</a> (30 minute read)</li></ul><p>(if you prefer video, I’d suggest also checking out the excellent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JavaScript Crash Course For Beginners video</a>, which is under 2 hours long)</p><p>Already familiar with other programming languages? Then you’ll probably pick up a lot right away.</p><p>New to coding? Then it might feel a little overwhelming. Don’t worry, that’s normal. Even if you feel you’re not getting everything, keep reading.

It covers pretty much all you’ll need to know to start working on JavaScript projects more fully.</p><h2 id=\"Step-8-The-best-way-but-not-the-only-way\"><a href=\"#Step-8-The-best-way-but-not-the-only-way\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Step 8: The best way, but not the only way\"></a>Step 8: The best way, but not the only way</h2><p>This approach is what I consider the best way to learn JavaScript, but I want to be clear it is far from the only way.</p><p>There are lots of very heated debates about what to start learning first, and why one approach is better than others.</p><p>Clearly I believe in this approach, but I don’t believe that other approaches are wrong, or that if you don’t follow this one you’ll be in trouble.</p><p>A common debate is learning a programming language first vs learning a framework first.</p><p>I’m very much in the camp of learning JavaScript before a JS framework or library, such as Reach or Vue, but there are lots of folks who learned a framework, library, or something else first, and then went back to learn more about the underlying language, and that approach can work great too!</p><p>The last thing I’d want to be responsible for is making someone feel bad or discouraged because they wanted to learn another way, read this, and then felt they had to take this approach when they didn’t want to.</p><p>This fits into the point above of “Alter this plan if you have a different approach,” and the reason I’m adding to that idea is to reassure you that there isn’t one right way, even when I think my approach is the best</p><h2 id=\"Step-9-This-is-for-everyone\"><a href=\"#Step-9-This-is-for-everyone\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Step 9: This is for everyone\"></a>Step 9: This is for everyone</h2><p>The point I’m about to make is becoming less of an issue, but it’s still worth making.</p><p>What I’ve outlined here is for everyone who wants to learn JavaScript. No exceptions.</p><p>There seems to be less and less gatekeeping around this as time goes on, but there are still plenty of folks who treat learning tech as something that only certain people can learn, or worse yet, only people who fit certain demographics are capable of learning.</p><p>Let me be clear. People who believe this, repeat this, or say this, are one of two things: stupid or lying.</p><p>That’s all there is to it.</p><p>They might buy into dangerous stereotypes, or maybe they’re just lying to themselves, but everything outlined here is learnable by anyone who wants to put the time and effort in.</p><p>Now not everyone could learn all of this in one week, or learn every concept on first exposure to it. But with enough time and work, you can learn JavaScript.</p><p>Just need to put the work in to learning it.</p><h2 id=\"Step-10-Get-to-work\"><a href=\"#Step-10-Get-to-work\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Step 10: Get to work!\"></a>Step 10: Get to work!</h2><p>This article should give you the straightforward plan you need to get started.</p><p><strong>In the simplest terms:</strong></p><ul><li>Read the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MDN crash course doc</a> and/or watch the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JavaScript Crash Course For Beginners video</a></li><li>Then for every section you read of <a href=\"https://javascript.info/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">javascript.info</a></li><li>Do three challenges on <a href=\"https://edabit.com/challenges/javascript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Edabit</a></li><li>Repeat all of this until you feel solid on the language</li></ul><p>Then after that:</p><ul><li>Learn HTML and CSS from <a href=\"https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Interneting Is Hard</a></li><li>Work on projects from <a href=\"https://javascript30.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JavaScript 30</a></li></ul><p>That’s all there is to it, so get to work!</p>"}],"PostAsset":[],"PostCategory":[],"PostTag":[],"Tag":[{"name":"tag1","_id":"ck296n6au0000bbp9dl55hwud"},{"name":"tag2","_id":"ck296qoog000ac7p95qc90228"}]}}
