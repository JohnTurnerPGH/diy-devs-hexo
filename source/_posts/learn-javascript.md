Learn JavaScript, huzzah!!!

How does the <code>inline code</code> look on here?

Quick test of adding code below

<pre><code class="language-js">let exampeVar = 'how does this look?';

let anotherExample = 'here is a very long string to test to see how the whole word wrap stuff adjusts to different size windows';

function fancyFeast(num) {
  return num * 5;
}

console.log(fancyFeast(12));
</code></pre>

Think this is all going okay after all! :)
