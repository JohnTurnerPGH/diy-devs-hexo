_Want to learn JavaScript? Here is a simple, direct way to learn JS, without having to spend any money. (x min read)_

**Who this is for:** Anyone new to coding who wants to learn JavaScript, folks who already know how to code but want to learn JavaScript, and people who want to learn how to program, but don't know where to start.

**What you need:** Any device that can access a webpage

**Ideal to have:** A device with a large screen (tablet) or a device with a physical keyboard (laptop, desktop, Chromebook)

There are lots of challenges for anyone looking to learn to code, but learning your first programming language is often the most worrying of all the things you'll need to learn.

Beyond picking the first language to start learning, this is also the area that often feels like it has the steepest learning curve to it, even if you already feel like you're fairly tech savvy.

**Which language should you learn first?**

I'd say start with JavaScript.

Reasons to start with JavaScript:

- If you need to build anything for the web, you'll have to use JavaScript to some extent
- As the web has grown, so have the use cases for JavaScript, so you can use your JavaScript skills in lots of different ways
- Because it's built into every web browser, you can play around with it without any setup

That last point is probably the most important, because while there are lots of other languages that are often recommended for beginners (Python being one of the most recommended for beginners), not needing to set anything up is a big plus, especially if you're learning on a device that limits what you can install, such as a smart phone or tablet.

But where to start?

There are a lot of online resources for learning JavaScript, the only problem being that many of these resources are out of date, incomplete, or contain errors. And too many folks that put together guides go with the approach of "here are a dozen sites, figure it out" which is overwhelming if you're just starting.

This is the guide I wish I had when I was first learning to code, and I hope it saves you a lot of frustration and time!

## Step 1: Crash course ([MDN crash course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript))

All you have to do on your first day of learning JavaScript is read thru this:

<!-- - [javascript-crash-course.md](https://gist.github.com/not-an-aardvark/cb9dbfba750e9a28cb78447491a1d079) (5 minute read) -->

<!-- - [Learn these JavaScript fundamentals and become a better developer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-these-javascript-fundamentals-and-become-a-better-developer-2a031a0dc9cf/) (10 minute read) -->

- [A re-introduction to JavaScript (JS tutorial)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) (30 minute read)

(if you prefer video, I'd suggest also checking out the excellent [JavaScript Crash Course For Beginners video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c), which is under 2 hours long)

Already familiar with other programming languages? Then you'll probably pick up a lot right away.

New to coding? Then it might feel a little overwhelming. Don't worry, that's normal. Even if you feel you're not getting everything, keep reading. This will be helpful not only in getting started, but later on will serve as markers to help you realize how far you've come.

Everyday after this will combine step 2 and 3 together.

## Step 2: The textbook to use - [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)

Not that long ago, when the internet was much slower and harder to access, the preferred way to learn programming was thru books. Books are still a great way to learn, but at the time they were the main way to learn to code.

There are a million stories of someone finding one big textbook, reading it cover to cover, and that being how they got started.

The problem with physical books is that they can quickly become outdated, as well as the cost and access issues associated with physical goods.

But I've found the best JavaScript textbook available online: [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)

It's an extremely clear, well written walk thru of all the different concepts in JavaScript, broken up into around 160 different sections, or about 700 pages if it was printed out on paper.

Just start with the [first section](https://javascript.info/intro), read it and keep going.

But because a big part of learning to code is also implementing code to see the results and getting used to the concepts, a textbook like this isn't the whole picture. You also need to be able to practice.

## Step 3: Practice problems to solve - [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/javascript)

You can learn with just a textbook, but it can be kinda hard.

When I learned math in school, it wasn't just reading a chapter and assuming that I knew the material. It was doing practice problems, often very similar ones over and over until the material became second nature.

Along the same line, there are lots of websites that give you coding practice, by presenting to you different types of coding challenges and problems to solve.

The problem is that most of these sites are designed for folks who already know how to code, and want to sharpen their skills, but are quite challenging for those new to coding.

This is where [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/javascript) comes in.

It's designed with beginners in mind, starting off with simple problems and progressively getting harder. On top of that, each problem has a resources tab that can help point you in the right direction of how to solve a problem, without giving too much away.

The only downsides with Edabit are that the site isn't the easiest to use on a smaller screen device, and the site can be a little slow, but it's the best option I've seen out there for good coding challenges for beginners.

## Step 4: Alternate between javascript.info and Edabit

Once you get past your first day of the crash course articles, you'll be faced with the question of where to start first: javascript.info or Edabit?

The answer is to alternate between them.

Being able to move from one to the other will help keep things fresh and interesting, and allow you to alternate between different modes of learning, helping you reinforce the material you're studying.

My suggestion is to use this ratio, in this order:

- One javascript.info section
- Three Edabit challenges

The only real downside to this approach is that the two resources don't perfectly line up. They were made independently from each other, and while they both feel like the missing half for the other, some problems on Edabit around things like regex and recursion aren't covered until much later in javascript.info.

It's also okay to skip problems on Edabit until you learn those topics, or skip ahead in javascript.info so you can tackle them in Edabit.

But roughly this ratio will work pretty well for you.

## Step 5: Do a little bit every day

With something like this, it's easy to get overwhelmed. Around 160 sections to read, and almost 1000 problems to work on. It can feel like a lot!

The easiest approach I've found for tackling a big task like this is simple: do a little bit, every single day.

It doesn't have to be a lot, you can just read one section and complete three problems and then stop. But don't take any days off.

Keep track of your progress of doing a little work each day, using a habit tracking app like Habit List or Habit Bull, or even a physical calendar, and after a while it'll feel like something you'll just do, not something you'll dread.

And the funny thing about habits like this is that once you build a small habit, it doesn't seem like a big deal to do a little more work on top of that, helping you to get more done and learn more faster.

## Step 6: Tips for success

Here are a few helpful tips that will go a long way in aiding you on this path.

### Stick to the plan

- repeat as needed
- commit to doing this publicly
- change the ratio if you have a different approach
- substitute other resources in if you have a fav (but don't do this on impulse)

## Step 7: What to do next

- projects, but since you'll need more stuff to do that, as well as other skills, keep at this plan until you feel you know this content really well
