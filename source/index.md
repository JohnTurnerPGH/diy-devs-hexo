**Hi there, I'm John, and I've put together a number of guides and posts to help you learn how to code and become a developer.**

Here is a list of the guides I've written so far:

- [The Most Direct Way to Learn JavaScript (for free)](/learn-javascript/)
- _No Budget Coding Bootcamp (coming soon)_

<!-- You can learn more about me on [my about page](/about/). -->

Please check back in the future for more guides, or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JohnTurnerPGH) to receive updates.
