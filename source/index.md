_Hi there, I'm John, and I've put together a number of guides and posts to help you learn how to code and become a developer._

Here is a list of the guides I've written so far:

- [The Most Direct Way to Learn JavaScript (for free)](/learn-javascript/)
- ~~No Budget Coding Bootcamp~~ (coming very soon)

<!-- You can learn more about me on [my about page](/about/). -->

Subscribe to the <a href="/rss2.xml" target="_blank">RSS feed</a>, or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JohnTurnerPGH), to find out when new guides and resources are released.

<!-- OLD CODE BELOW!!! -->

<!-- Learn JavaScript, huzzah!!!

How does the <code>inline code</code> look on here?

Quick test of adding code below

<pre><code class="language-js">let exampeVar = 'how does this look?';

let anotherExample = 'here is a very long string to test to see how the whole word wrap stuff adjusts to different size windows';

function fancyFeast(num) {
  return num * 5;
}

console.log(fancyFeast(12));
</code></pre>

Think this is all going okay after all! :) -->
